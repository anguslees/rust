License: LGPL-3
 "The auxiliary file src/etc/pkg/modpath.iss contains a library routine
 compiled, by Inno Setup, into the Windows installer binary. This file
 is licensed under the LGPL, version 3, but, in our legal
 interpretation, this does not affect the aggregate "collected work"
 license of the Rust distribution (MIT/ASL2) nor any other components
 of it. We believe that the terms governing distribution of the binary
 Windows installer built from modpath.iss are therefore LGPL, but not
 the terms governing distribution of any of the files installed by
 such an installer (such as the Rust compiler or runtime libraries
 themselves)."
